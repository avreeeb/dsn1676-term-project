    <p class="island os">Grand Jedi Master Yoda is among the oldest and most powerful known Jedi Masters in the Star Wars universe. Series creator George Lucas opted to have many details of the character's life history remain unknown. Yoda's race and home world have not been named in any media, canonical or otherwise, and he is merely said to be of a species unknown by the Star Wars Databank. Yoda's speech syntax has been analyzed and discussed by academic syntacticians, who found it somewhat inconsistent, but could extrapolate that it has object–subject–verb word order.</p>

    <p class="island os"> Chewbacca belongs to the Wookie species, who are tall, hirsute bipeds native to the planet of Kashyyyk. Chewbacca is fiercely loyal to Han Solo, and serves as co-pilot on Solo's Millenium Falcon. Chewbacca's creation as a gentle, hairy, non-English-speaking co-pilot was inspired by George Lucas seeing his own dog sitting up on the passenger seat of his car. The dog, named Indiana, also inspired the name of the lead character in another one of Lucas' film franchises - Indiana Jones. It is said that Chewbacca's name is derived from собака (sobaka), the Russian word for dog.</p>

    <p class="island pad3 os"> C-3PO is a protocol droid designed to serve human beings, and boasts that he is fluent in over six million forms of communication. He is generally seen with his long-time counterpart, R2-D2. Threepio's main function is to assist etiquette, customs, and translation, so that meetings of different cultures run smoothly. Threepio and R2-D2 played vital and pivotal roles in the Galaxy's history. While protocol/interpreter droids range in color, C-3PO appears primarily in gold finish with silver from the right knee down.</p>
